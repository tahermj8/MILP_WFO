## Prerequisites

All the required packages for running the scripts in a conda environment can be installed using **milp_wfo_environment.yml**

## Files

**ml_wake_model.py** - Will create a training dataset and generate an ANN ML model to use with the wind farm optimization model**

**wind_farm_gurobi_opt.py** - Will perform a wind farm micro-siting optimization using the ANN model for wake effect prediction.

This file can run independently as well to generate an ANN model as well and then perform wind farm layout micro-siting optimization.

**examples/Models/test_model_wind.xlsx** - All user inputs can be defined here. Both scripts take this file as the default input file.
