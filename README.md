## Features
- Wind farm micrositing optimization using MILP
- ANN wake model for wake effect prediction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tahermj8/MILP_WFO.git
   ```

2. Create a conda environment using the YAML file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f milp_wfo.yml
   ```

3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate milp_wfo
   ```

## Usage
To run the wind farm optimization:
```bash
wind_farm_gurobi_opt.py
```

Ensure that Gurobi is correctly licensed before running the model.

## Example
Some examples are given in `wind_opt_results/`.

## Project Structure
